# MonyBall_MultileanerRegression
**The famous money ball story** <br />
Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), general manager of the Oakland A's, one day has an epiphany: Baseball's conventional wisdom is all wrong. Faced with a tight budget, Beane must reinvent his team by outsmarting the richer ball clubs. Joining forces with Ivy League graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), Beane prepares to challenge old-school traditions. He recruits bargain-bin players whom the scouts have labeled as flawed, but have game-winning potential. Based on the book by Michael Lewis.<br />
• Played major league baseball.<br />
• Sees himself as a typical scouting error.<br />
• Understood the importance of statistics – hired Paul DePodesta (a Harvard graduate) as his assistant his analysis suggested that some skills were undervalued and some skills were overvalued.<br />
• If they could detect the undervalued skills, they could find players at a bargain.<br />

This project is a multilinear regressin model that predicts **how many wins it would take to make it to the playoffs.** by answering questions like:<br />
How many runs scored are needed more than runs allowed?<br />
How does a team score many runs?<br />
